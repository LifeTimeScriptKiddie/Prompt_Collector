Unlike traditional data caches, the \"cache\" in this context primarily refers to two key components that aid in efficient and context-aware AI operations:\n\n1.  **Command Map (`CommandMapProcessor` & `ContextIntelligenceAPI`):** For NLP-to-Tool mapping.\n2.  **Context Tree (`ContextTreeBuilder`):** For constructing rich, contextual information for system awareness and prompt injection.\n\nThese components work together to provide runtime understanding and a dynamic \"working memory\" for agents and the SDK itself.\n\n## 1. Command Map: NLP-to-Tool Invocation\n\nThe Command Map provides the ability to translate natural language queries or predefined patterns into specific tool invocations. It acts as a runtime lookup for NLP-driven actions.\n\n**Core Components:**\n\n*   **`ToolRegistry`:** The central registry where all tools (their definitions and handlers) are stored.\n*   **`CommandMapProcessor` (`src/cache/map-processor.ts`):**\n    *   Maintains an in-memory map (`Map<string, Pattern>`) where keys are NLP trigger strings (or pattern IDs) and values are `Pattern` objects detailing the associated tool, parameter mappings, etc.\n    *   **Initialization:**\n        *   Loads predefined patterns from an XML file (e.g., `src/cache/command-map.xml`) during its initialization. These are typically system-level or core tool NLP triggers.\n        *   Can also load and reconcile these XML patterns with versions stored in the `xml_patterns` database table.\n    *   **Runtime Additions:**\n        *   `addRuntimePatternToMemory(nlpPattern: string, toolCallDetails: RuntimeToolCallDetails)`: Allows new NLP patterns to be added to the in-memory map during a session. `toolCallDetails` specifies the target tool name and parameters. This is the primary mechanism for dynamically extending NLP understanding.\n        *   `persistRuntimePattern(patternToPersist: Pattern)`: Can persist a runtime-added `Pattern` object to the `xml_patterns` database table (note: this differs from the `nlp_patterns` table used by `NlpService` for user/SDK-defined patterns).\n        *   `addAndPersistRuntimePattern(...)`: Combines the above two.\n    *   **Processing:**\n        *   `processUserInput(input: string, sessionId?: string)`: Takes a user input string, attempts to find the best matching pattern in its map, extracts variables, and determines the tool call to make.\n*   **`ContextIntelligenceAPI` (`src/cache/intelligence-api.ts`):**\n    *   Acts as a higher-level interface that often utilizes `CommandMapProcessor`.\n    *   `registerToolNlpMapping({ toolName, nlpPattern, source })`: This is a key method called (e.g., by `NlpService`) to register a simple NLP pattern string and associate it directly with a `toolName`. It typically uses `CommandMapProcessor.addRuntimePatternToMemory` under the hood.\n*   **`NlpService` (`src/nlp/NlpService.ts`):**\n    *   `loadPatternToRuntime(patternDef: NlpPatternDefinition)`: Takes an `NlpPatternDefinition` (which includes `toolName` and `nlpPattern`) and calls `contextIntelligenceApi.registerToolNlpMapping` to make it active in the runtime command map.\n    *   `loadAllPersistedPatternsToRuntime()`: Loads all active patterns from the `nlp_patterns` database table and registers them into the runtime command map via `loadPatternToRuntime`. This happens during SDK initialization.\n\n**How it Works Currently:**\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   `CommandMapProcessor` loads system XML patterns.\n    *   `NlpService` (during SDK init via `ToolRegistry.initializeAutoPopulation`) loads all active patterns from the `nlp_patterns` DB into the runtime command map via `ContextIntelligenceAPI`.\n2.  **Tool Creation (`ToolService.create`):**\n    *   If a `ToolConfig` includes an `nlp` string, `ToolService` calls `NlpService.loadPatternToRuntime()`.\n    *   This registers the tool's `nlp` string with its `toolName` in the runtime command map via `ContextIntelligenceAPI`.\n    *   **No database persistence of this NLP pattern occurs automatically from `tool.create`** (assuming `persistNlpOnInit` is removed or false, which is the recommended path).\n3.  **Dynamic Additions (e.g., by an Agent/System):**\n    *   A service could expose functionality that calls `CommandMapProcessor.addRuntimePatternToMemory` (likely via `ContextIntelligenceAPI` or `NlpService`) to teach the system new NLP phrases for existing tools during a session.\n4.  **Invocation:**\n    *   When natural language input needs to be processed for tool invocation (e.g., by an agent or a central dispatcher), it would query the `CommandMapProcessor` (e.g., via `CacheIntelligenceService.getIntelligence` or a similar high-level SDK function).\n    *   The `CommandMapProcessor` finds the best match and returns the intended tool and parameters.\n\n**Functionality Provided by Command Map:**\n*   Enables natural language understanding for tool invocation.\n*   Maps user-friendly phrases or specific patterns to concrete tool actions.\n*   Allows dynamic, in-session learning/registration of new NLP triggers.\n*   Decouples the raw LLM from needing to know every exact tool function signature if common tasks have NLP triggers.\n\n## 2. Context Tree (`ContextTreeBuilder`)\n\nThe Context Tree dynamically constructs a hierarchical representation of the current state and relevant history for a given session. This tree is intended to be a rich source of context for agents or for injection into LLM prompts to improve situational awareness and response quality.\n\n**Core Components:**\n\n*   **`ContextTreeBuilder` (`src/cache/tree-builder.ts`):**\n    *   **Initialization:**\n        *   Can be initialized with a path to a base context template JSON file. If not provided, uses a default minimal structure.\n    *   **Building the Tree (`buildContextTree(sessionId, query?)`):**\n        *   This is the primary method. It is **read-only** from the perspective of external callers wanting to *modify* the tree structure directly.\n        *   It constructs the tree by fetching data from various `DatabaseService` methods:\n            *   `database.getSessionContext(sessionId)`: For session-specific data, user preferences, current task.\n            *   `database.getToolExecutions(sessionId, query?.limit)`: For recent tool usage.\n            *   `database.getWorkflowExecutions(sessionId)`: For active/recent workflows.\n            *   `database.getXMLPatterns(true)`: For information about learned/adapted patterns (currently from `xml_patterns`).\n        *   It assembles this data into a hierarchical structure of `ContextNode` objects.\n    *   **Nodes Types:** Includes `environment`, `workflow`, `tool` (executions), `user_data` (session info, preferences), `task`, and `learning` (adapted patterns).\n    *   **Caching:** Implements a simple in-memory LRU cache for recently built trees to avoid redundant reconstruction.\n    *   **Prompt Generation (`getContextForPrompt(sessionId, options?)`):** Flattens and formats the tree into a string suitable for LLM prompt injection, prioritizing relevant nodes.\n\n**How it Works Currently:**\n\n1.  **Data Collection:** When a context tree is requested for a `sessionId`, the `ContextTreeBuilder` queries the `DatabaseService` for the latest relevant information (session details, tool logs, workflow states, pattern confidences, etc.).\n2.  **Structure Assembly:** It organizes this information into a predefined, yet dynamic, hierarchical structure defined by its internal `build<Type>Node` methods (e.g., `buildEnvironmentNode`, `buildToolExecutionNode`).\n3.  **No Direct External Updates to Tree Structure:**\n    *   Agents or other services **do not directly call methods like `contextTreeBuilder.addNode(...)` or `updateNode(...)`**.\n    *   The tree is a *representation* of the current state derived primarily from the database.\n4.  **\"Updating\" the Context Tree (Implicitly):**\n    *   For the context tree to reflect new information (e.g., a tool was just run, user preferences changed), that new information **must first be persisted to the database** by the relevant service (e.g., `ToolService` via `ToolRegistry` might log tool execution, a user profile service might update session context in the DB).\n    *   The *next time* `buildContextTree` is called, it will fetch this updated data from the database and construct a new tree that reflects these changes.\n\n**Functionality Provided by Context Tree:**\n*   Provides a structured, comprehensive snapshot of the current session's context.\n*   Includes environment details, recent tool activity, active workflows, user session data, and learning adaptations.\n*   Can be transformed into a string format suitable for augmenting LLM prompts, giving the LLM better situational awareness.\n*   Helps in maintaining a \"short-term to medium-term working memory\" for the system regarding a specific interaction or session.\n\n## Relationship & Injection into System Prompts\n\n*   The **Command Map** is used by the system (e.g., an agent or NLP routing logic) to understand *how to act* based on an NLP input.\n*   The **Context Tree** is generated to provide *situational awareness*. Its string representation (from `getContextForPrompt`) can be injected into system prompts for LLMs or be available to agents for decision-making.\n\nThis combination allows the system to both understand natural language commands (via Command Map) and operate with a rich understanding of the ongoing interaction and environment (via Context Tree).\n\n## Current State of Update Logic:\n\n*   **Command Map (Runtime):**\n    *   **Can be updated:** Yes, via `NlpService.loadPatternToRuntime()` (called by `ToolService.create` if `nlp` is in config) or by direct use of `CommandMapProcessor.addRuntimePatternToMemory()`. This adds new NLP triggers for the current session.\n*   **Command Map (Persistent - `xml_patterns` via `CommandMapProcessor`):**\n    *   **Can be updated:** Yes, `CommandMapProcessor.persistRuntimePattern()` allows saving new patterns. Updates to existing XML patterns would typically involve modifying the source XML and re-initializing or specific DB updates.\n*   **Command Map (Persistent - `nlp_patterns` via `NlpService`):**\n    *   **Can be updated:** Yes, via `NlpService.ensurePatternPersisted()`, `addNlpPattern()`, `updateNlpPattern()`, `deleteNlpPattern()`, and `seedPatternsFromFile()`. This is the primary mechanism for managing user/SDK-defined NLP patterns meant for persistence and auto-loading.\n*   **Context Tree:**\n    *   **Cannot be directly updated by an agent/service calling a method on `ContextTreeBuilder`.**\n    *   **Is updated implicitly:** By services writing new data (tool executions, session changes, workflow states) to the database. The `ContextTreeBuilder` then reconstructs the tree with this new data on its next build.\n\nThis documentation should clarify the current mechanisms. The \"cache\" is dynamic and intelligent, not just a simple key-value store for data. "
