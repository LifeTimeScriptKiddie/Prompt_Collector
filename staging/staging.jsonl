  "data": "# FAQ\n\n**Q: Why not attributes/annotations in the language itself?**  \nBecause we need something that works in *every* language and every file type today.\n\n**Q: Won’t people abuse Force?**  \nCode owners + CI + review gates. Force is a conscious override with explicit cleanup/explain annotations in the diff.\n\n**Q: Why JSON over YAML?**  \nJSON is stricter and easier to parse cheaply. YAML is allowed for humans who insist.\n\n**Q: What about huge regions?**  \nUse `scope: region` with an explicit `@LLMAL:REGION-END` and consider splitting files.\n\n**Q: How do we ensure models respect this?**  \nPre-prompt injection + CI as backstop. Don’t rely on one layer.\n"
