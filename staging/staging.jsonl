={"data":"------- Important tasks\n\n#  -- [✅ Done] Change analysis file code to newly refactored code and ensure user id is added with the analysis report.\n\n -- [🟡 Partially Done] Make backend fully compatible with newly refactored python code.\n\n -- [🟡 Partially Done] Check all files calling backend for analysis and ensure correct Python endpoints are used.\n\n -- [🟡 Partially Done] Refactor backend for speed/efficiency after above is done.\n\n -- [🟡 Partially Done] Remove unnecessary files in backend folder.\n\n -- [🟡 Partially Done] Data fetching process: Backend should fetch from MongoDB after python server signals completion. Remove any unnecessary data fetching in python server. (Testing remaining)\n\n -- [🟡 Partially Done] Ensure all python backend endpoints are correctly connected to backend (analysis function). (Locally running correctly, testing remaining)\n\n#  -- [✅ Done] Backend fetches analysis data directly from MongoDB after python server signals completion. (Robust, less load on python server)\n\n#  -- [✅ Done] Code conflict (uncommented code) resolved as per above logic.\n\n -- [🟡 Partially Done] Test UI improvements for mobile responsiveness.\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Add file/code style guide for consistency (e.g., camelCase in DB, etc.)\n\n -- [✅ Done] Backend and python server both allow job description in pdf, docx, and txt formats.

(Validation added, needs more testing)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] If user tries to sign up with temp mail, show clear error message (logic exists, improve error text)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Separate admin module in backend from normal user code.\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Remove unnecessary 'analyzing report' wait page when moving from view detail to content page.\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Improve dashboard UI, add download/export report feature.\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Improve analysis page UI (color, width, file icon placement, font, etc.)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Add max input token limit for Groq API, prevent repeated analysis requests. (Code added, needs testing)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Limit daily analysis requests per user (reduce from 15 to 5 or 3 for production)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Add/validate limits: job description length (500-1000 words), file size (<5MB), max pages (5-7), etc.\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Add Google sign-in/sign-up (only required data)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Export full analysis report in profile (currently only profile info is downloaded)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Change '0% Avg Match Rate' to something else\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Make dark theme consistent everywhere (dashboard/analysis, navbar, footer, etc.)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Add validation to prevent prompt injection in job description/resume (logic added, needs more testing)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Separate mobile responsive CSS from main CSS if files are too big\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Improve Footer UI for mobile, revert to old UI for desktop\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Improve mobile navbar\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Use Claude Opus 4 (Thinking) model for analysis\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Add login/sign up with Google authentication\n\n -- [✅ Done] Remove unnecessary homepage CSS files\n\n -- [✅ Done] Integrate feedback option after analysis (testing remaining)\n\n -- [✅ Done] Add admin panel for monitoring usage and improvements\n\n -- [✅ Done] Add option for user to give suggestions after analysis result\n\n -- [✅ Done] Add validation to not show unrelated answers in analysis (testing remaining)\n\n -- [✅ Done] Fix 'content too long' logic for normal analysis\n\n-------- Future/Optional Features --------\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Add freemium version/payment gateway\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Add option for user to see resume improvement suggestions\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Enhanced analytics & reporting (time-based filtering, advanced charts, trend analysis, export, etc.)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Real-time features (notifications, WebSocket, activity monitoring, system alerts)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Advanced user management (bulk ops, analytics, recovery, logs)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] System admin (audit trail, config, backup, performance, error tracking)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Data management (export/import, cleanup, storage monitoring)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Security enhancements (admin logging, IP whitelist, session mgmt, alerts)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Communication features (email, messaging, announcements, support)\n\n -- [⏳ Pending] Advanced analytics (ML insights, predictions, custom reports, viz)\n\n -- [✅ Done] How We Compare feature\n\n -- [✅ Done] Admin cannot access profile page/change password/delete account\n\n -- [✅ Done] Save password/email in browser (mostly done)\n"}
