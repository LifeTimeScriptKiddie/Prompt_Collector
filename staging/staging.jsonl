  "data": "# Amias' StreamElements Chat commands\n\nThis page is a collection of chat commands for the streamelements chat bot. \n\n\n## Commands\n\nTo use them just copy and paste them into a streamelements chat where you have admin.\n\n### Crackers \npull a cracker with someone and generate a random winner and prize\n```\n!cmd edit cracker ${sender} pulls a cracker with ${1} , > BANG!! <, ${random.pick ${sender} ${1} } wins ${random.pick \"a shitfish\" \"some nailclippers\" \"a dice\" \"some coal\" \"small cards\" \"a crap magic trick\" \"the precious\"}\n!cracker AUser\nStreamElements: AmiasC pulls a cracker with AUser , > BANG!! <, AUser wins the precious\n```\n\n### Shitfish\n\nThis is like thin plastic crappy little fortune telling fish you got in a cracker\n```\n!command add shitfish The shifish has seen your future, you will ${random.pick \"be wealthy\" \"be loved\" \"be ignored\" \"be despised\" \"be admired\" \"be custard pied on the

\"head\" \"shoulders\" \"aura\"} of ${random.chatter} and ${random.pick \"hits the target\" \"misses\" \"misses badly\" \"hits ${random.chatter}\"}\n\n!trickshot\n\n!command del trickshot\n```\n\n### Animals \n\ni've been making custom animals for some of the chats\n\n#### Geese\n```\n!command add geese ${repeat ${1} ' -<}>----*~ ' }\n!geese 5\nStreamElements: -<}>----*~ -<}>----*~ -<}>----*~ -<}>----*~ -<}>----*~\n```\n\n#### Ducks\n```\n !command add ducks ${repeat ${1} ' -<}>-*~ ' }\n !ducks 5\n StreamElements: -<}>-*~ -<}>-*~ -<}>-*~ -<}>-*~ -<}>-*~\n```\n\n#### Fish of variable length\n```\n!command add fish }-~#${repeat ${1}#}#*>\n!fish 5\nStreamElements: }-~## # # # ##*>\n```\n\n#### Fish in variable quantites\n```\n!command add fishes ${repeat ${1} )~<###*> }\n!fishes 5\nStreamElements: )~<###*> )~<###*> )~<###*> )~<###*> )~<###*>\n```\n\n#### Snakes of variable length\n```\n!command add snake `-_${repeat ${1} -_ }-*~\n!snake 5\nStreamElements: `-_-_ -_ -_ -_ -_-*~\n```\n\n#### Random amount of snakes of variable type and quantity\nthis one is fun , it shows that the pick is done once at the beginning so each repetition is the same.\n```\n!command edit snakesr ${repeat ${random.2-10} ${random.pick \"`-_-_-_-_-_-*~\" \",-_-_-*~\" \"~*-_-_-`\" \"~*-_-_-_-_-`\" } }\n!snakesr\nStreamElements: ~*-_-_-_-_-` ~*-_-_-_-_-` ~*-_-_-_-_-`\n```\n\n#### Random amount of fish of variable type and length\nthis has the same limitation as the previous , only one random.pick per invocation \n```\n!cmd add fishr ${repeat ${random.2-10} ${random.pick \">-<###*>\" \"<*###>=<\" \">-<3#*>\" \"<*3333>~{\" } }\n!fishr\nStreamElements: >-<###*> >-<###*> >-<###*> >-<###*> >-<###*> >-<###*> >-<###*>\n```\n\n#### Talking Snake \nCreate a snake of a variable length that says a message\n```\n!command edit snakesay `-_${repeat ${1} -_ }-*~ \" ${2:} \"\n!snakesay 5 listen to the snake , what could go wrong\nStreamElements: `-_-_ -_ -_ -_-*~ \" listen to the snake, what could go wrong \"\n\n```\n## Emojis\n\nEmojis are an easy way to get graphics into your commands, they vary depending on the system displaying them.\n\n### Emoju Banners \n\nYou can use repeat to make emoji banners , these get picked up by the stream elements layer if that is available, this can make a nice kappagen effect.\n\n#### Love hearts\n```\n!cmd add hearts ${repeat ${1} ❤️}\n!hearts 50\nStreamElements: ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️\n```\n\n#### Poop\n```\n!cmd add poops ${repeat ${1} 💩}\n!poops 💩\nStreamElements: 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩 💩\n\n```\n\n#### Rainbows \n```\n!cmd add rainbows ${repeat ${1} ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜}\n!rainbows 10\nStreamElements: ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜\n```\n\n### Emoji Commands\nYou can also make commands that have names that include emojis or are just emojis\n```\n!cmd add ❤️ ${repeat ${1} ❤️}\n!❤️ 50\nStreamElements: ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️\n```\n\n## Twitter Feeds \n\nTwitter feeds are good way to get changing data in the chat, lasttweet will give you the last tweet posted on that account.\nNeeds to be quite a busy account to be worth it. \n\nUPDATE: the ongoing enshitification of twitter means feeds are not working and probably not coming back :-(\n\n\n### Reporting stream properties \nThis one gives a quick overview of how the stream is doing \n```\n!cmd edit stats This channel currently has ${channel.subs} subscribers, ${channel.followers} followers. ${channel.viewers} live viewers and has been seen ${channel.views} times\n!stats\n```\n\nThis one prints your details to the channel\n```\n !cmd edit userstats ${user} $ ${user.points} ${pointsname} ${user.points_rank}) @ ${user.time_online} ${user.time_online_rank}\n !userstats\n```\n\n\n### Changing stream properties\n\nThese are a bit dangerous and should probably only be used with active mods to switch it back.\nChanging these can make the VOD recording split. \n\nAllow anyone to change the stream title \n```\n!cmd add set-stream-title ${settitle ${1:}}\n!set-stream-title a very silly title with spaces in it\nStreamElements: a very silly title with spaces in it\n```\n\nAllow anyone to change the stream game , this will be matched against twitches catagories.\n```\n!cmd add set-stream-game ${setgame ${1:} }\n!set-stream-game Snooker\nStreamElements: Snooker\n```\n### Get and Set variables \n\nGet and set named numeric variables , can be used to configure commands\n```\n!command add get ${getcount ${1}}\n!command add set ${count ${1} ${2}}\n\n!set this that \n!get this \n\n!command del get\n!command add set\n```\n\nA community BPM counter, shows how multiple commands and users can access the same bpm value \n```\n !cmd add bpm Currently at ${getcount bpm} BPM\n !cmd add faster ${count bpm +1} BPM\n !cmd add slower ${count bpm -1} BPM\n !cmd add muchfaster ${count bpm +10} BPM\n !cmd add muchslower ${count bpm -10} BPM\n !cmd add wayfaster ${count bpm +50} BPM\n !cmd add wayslower ${count bpm -50} BPM\n```\nthe count tokens seem to get replaced before the '$user'  tokens, so you can not do things like \n '${count ${user.name}counter }' or '${getcount ${user.name}counter }'  which would have been a per user (but not private) counter.\n\n### Parameters\n\nYou can copy user parameters into your commands by referring to them as $1 $2 $3.\nThey are speerated by spaces \ne.g. \n```\n!mycommand one two three\n!mycommand this is a sentance\n```\nwill give you in $1 one , in $2 two, it $3 three \n\nYou can concatenate them $1:$2  \nYou can refer to a range $1:$3 \nif you refer to a parameter that isn't specified the command doesn't run\nit would near if you could specify multiple versions with different parameter combinations but you cant \nYou can leave the other half empty to get everything from then on e.g $1: will allways be everything in one variable.\n\n#### Meta commands\n$0 will always be the name of the command , you can use this to make extensible meta commands by aliasing them \n```\n!cmd add wash ${sender} ${0}s the ${1}\n!cmd alias add wash scrub\n!wash car\nStreamElements: AmiasC washs the car\n!scrub car\nStreamElements: AmiasC scrubs the car\n!cmd alias add wash powerwash\n!powerwash car \nStreamElements: AmiasC powerwashes the car\n```\nThis is useful because you can edit wash and scrub and powerwash will change as well \n\n#### Dub\n\nThis command makes a fun use of parameter mangling and loops with a bit of randomness to make a dub version of the phrase you give it.\n```\n!cmd edit dub , ${1:} ${repeat ${random.1-2} ${2:}} ${repeat ${random.1-3} ${3:}} ${repeat ${random.1-4} ${4:}}\n!dub nuff dubs a gwarn\nStreamElements: , nuff dubs a gwarn..dubs a gwarn..a gwarn a gwarn..gwarn..\n```\n\n#### Decider\nThis command will answer questions for you \n```\n!cmd edit decider ${3:} ? ${random.pick ${1} ${2}}\n!decider Yes No Meat is Murder \nStreamelements: Meat is Muder ? Yes \n```\n\n### AI ###\n\nThis is WILD , there is now an ${ai  } command , it sends the contents to an llm and replaces the tag with results.\nThe LLM has a system prompt that sets up its role and applies basic content filtering. \n\nheres a basic guide to prompting LLMs\nhttps://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/how-to-talk-to-an-llm-llm-prompt-engineering-for-beginners/https://www.uctoday.com/unified-communications/how-to-talk-to-an-llm-llm-prompt-engineering-for-beginners/\n\n#### Static Queries ####\n\nYou can create commands to do a specific query  \n```\n!cmd add fishjoke ${ai tell a joke about fish}\n!fishjoke\nStreamelements: I would but this is not the plaice\n```\n\n#### Parameterised Queries ####\nYou can insert parameters in to the ai tag to make a general query system\n```\n!cmd add userhelp Userhelp: ${ai ${1:}} \n!userhelp how do i subscribe\nStreamelements: Userhelp: you can click the subscribe button to subscribe\n```\n\n#### Personalities ####\nYou can create commands that respond with different personalities by creating a parameterized query with an extra prompt\nMake sure to include the name of the voice you are creating in the streamelements output so you know who is saying what.\nTry to use as few words as possible and capitalise any names or nouns to ensure they get recognised.\n```\n!cmd add mum Mum: ${ai be a comically wholesome mum when you respond to this: ${1:}}\n!mum say hello to everyone \nStreamelements: Mum: Hello my lovely little cupcakes Sending each and every one of you a big virtual hug and a sprinkle of glitter to brighten your day 💖✨\n```\n\n### customapi ###\nThis is command that lets you pull in external data from webpages. Its very usefull for creating libraries of data for your commands.\n\nThis command would fetch weather data from a made up weather API at http://weather.com/forecast and supply it with an encoded HTTP Get param called location\n```\n!cmd add weather ${customapi.weather.com/forecast?location=${queryescape ${1:}}}\nStreamElements: Amsterdam, Netherlands: 🌞 8.0 °C (46.4 °F). Feels like 4.3 °C (39.8 °F). Light rain. Wind is blowing from the West at 31.0 km/h (19.2 mp/h). 71% humidity. Visibility: 10 km (6 miles). Air pressure: 1007 hPa.\n```\nThese customapi tags get parsed very early on so you can use them to do all sorts of injections of data.\n\n#### Random picks from api ####\nYou can put an api in to random.pick to have it split the result on commas and pick one part at random\nThis is ok for small lists but it has limited capacity and will silently truncate a long list.\n```\n!cmd add sandwich ${sender} orders a ${random.pick ${customapi.website.com/fillings}} and ${random.pick ${customapi.website.com/sauces} sandwich on ${random.pick ${customapi.website.com/breads}}\nStreamelements: amias orders Roasted Vegetable and Hummus sandwich on Cibatta\n```\n\nYou can also add local options to the same pick that contains api results \n```\n!cmd add override ${random.pick one,two,${customapi.website.com/other_options}}\n```\n\n#### Math.js scripts ####\nYou can use customapi to pull in files and run them as math.js scripts and have fun testing the limits of the node.js sandbox it will be run in.\n```\n!cmd add mathrun ${maths ${customapi.website.com/script.js}}\n```\n\n#### Prompt injection libraries ####\nYou can use customapi to pull in text for use in prompting the ai command \n```\n!cmd add mum Mum: ${ai ${customapi.website.com/prompt_wholesome_mum} ${1:} }\n```\n\n#### Using customapi as an injection library ####\nI wrote some code that runs a website which automates the process of defining customapi insert data.\nIts at http://api.amias.net/ and the code is at https://github.com/amias-channer/customapi-manager\n\n\n\n### Operators ###\n\nThis is a bit of a hack and it requires calling an extrnal script with customapi but it will allow you to have a conditionals.\n\n#### script parameters ###\n\nThe script takes the following parameters \n* a = the first value to compare.\n* b = the second value to compare. \n* o = the operator to use for comparison , default is eq = equal , ne = not equal , or = logical or , and = logical and, < = less than , > = greater than\n* t = value to return if true , defaults to first value\n* f = value to return if false , defaults to second value\n\nsome example calls of the script \n* ?a=1;b=1              This will check is A is stringwise equal to B and return 1 if it is and 0 if it is not\n* ?a=1;b=1;t=yes;f=no   Same as above but the string yes is returned for a match and no if not     \n* ?a=1;b=10;o=<         This will check if a < b \n* ?a=this;b=that;o=>    this will check the strings alphabetically\n\n#### script setup ####\n\nIn this example i am using an instance of my if.pl script at http://amias.net/if.pl \nPlease dont use my instance, it will block you without permission. get your own server.\n\nYou can download if.pl from here - https://github.com/amias-channer/obs-scripts/blob/master/if.pl\nYou need to edit the script and add your channel id to the allowed list before running it.\n\n#### channel id setup ####\n\nget your channel id by opening this link in the browser ( change kolanutwaffles for your channel name)  \nhttps://api.streamelements.com/kappa/v2/channels/kolanutwaffles  \nfrom the results of that you need the bit inside id=' ' it will be numbers and letters from a to f , hex.\n\nI also use ${queryescape} to url encode the parameters, its an annoying complication but it keeps it sane.\nIf you specify a parameter a corresponding argument must be provided or the call will not be made.\nA way round this is to to make if if3 if4 and if5 so each form can work for different needs.\n\n#### types \n\nthe operators are provided by Perl which is very leniant about comparison of different types but ultimately you can expect string comparison.\ndates might not compare sensibly, be sure to test and verify. http://web.mit.edu/perl5/www/man/perlop.html has the final word.\n\n#### examples ####\n\nso this is a basic form of if  \n```\n!command edit if ${customapi.amias.net/if.pl?a=${queryescape ${1}};b=${queryescape ${2}} }\n\n!if this that \n\n!if this this\nStreamElements: this\n```\nor the 3 argument form of if , note that b and o are wired to 3 and 2 to enable that more natural a op b ordering \n```\n!command edit if3 ${customapi.amias.net/if.pl?a=${queryescape ${1}};b=${queryescape ${3}};o=${queryescape ${2}} }\n!if3 1 < 10\nStreamElements: 1\n\n!if3 10 < 1\n\n!if3 10 > 1\nStreamElements: 10\n\n!if3 1 10 >\n\n```\nor the 4 and 5 argument forms for adding specific output for true and false \n```\n!command edit if4 ${customapi.amias.net/if.pl?a=${queryescape ${1}};b=${queryescape ${3}};o=${queryescape ${2}};t=${queryescape ${4}} }\n!command edit if5 ${customapi.amias.net/if.pl?a=${queryescape ${1}};b=${queryescape ${3}};o=${queryescape ${2}};t=${queryescape ${4}};f=${queryescape ${5}} }\n\n!if4 this eq that matches\n\n!if4 this eq this match\nStreamlabs: match\n!if5 this eq this match not\nStreamlabs: match\n!if5 this eq that match not\nStreamlabs: not\n```\n## Documentation\n\nA list of command variables you can use with these scripts can be found here \nhttps://streamelements.com/dashboard/bot/command-variables\n"
