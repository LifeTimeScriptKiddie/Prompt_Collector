Dolly 1.0 was trained for $30 using a dataset that the Stanford Alpaca team had created using the OpenAI API. That dataset contained output from ChatGPT, and as the Stanford team pointed out, the terms of service seek to prevent anyone from creating a model that competes with OpenAI. So, unfortunately, the answer to this common question was, “probably not!” As far as we know, all the existing well-known instruction-following models ([Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html), [Koala](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2023/04/03/koala/), [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all), [Vicuna](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/)) suffer from this limitation, prohibiting commercial use.\n\t- 2.0 https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm\n\t\t- We knew from the OpenAI research [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155.pdf) that the original InstructGPT model was trained on a dataset consisting of 13,000 demonstrations of instruction following behavior\n\t\t- Databricks has over 5,000 employees who are very interested in LLMs. So we thought we could crowdsource among them to create an even higher quality dataset than the 40 labelers had created for OpenAI.\n\t\t- We set up a contest, where the top 20 labelers would get a big award. We also outlined 7 very specific tasks:\n\t\t\t-   Open Q&A: For instance, “Why do people like comedy movies?” or “What is the capital of France?” In some cases, there’s not a correct answer, and in others, it requires drawing on knowledge of the world at large.\n\t\t\t-   Closed Q&A: These are questions that can be answered using only the information contained in a passage of reference text. For instance, given a paragraph from Wikipedia on the atom, one might ask, “What is the ratio between protons and neutrons in the nucleus?”\n\t\t\t-   Extract information from Wikipedia: Here an annotator would copy a paragraph from Wikipedia and extract entities or other factual information such as weights or measurements from the passage.\n\t\t\t-   Summarize information from Wikipedia: For this, annotators provided a passage from Wikipedia and were asked to distill it to a short summary.\n\t\t\t-   Brainstorming: This task asked for open-ended ideation and an associated list of possible options. For instance, “What are some fun activities I can do with my friends this weekend?”.\n\t\t\t-   Classification: For this task, annotators were asked to make judgments about class membership (e.g. are the items in a list animals, minerals or vegetables) or to judge the properties of a short passage of text, such as the sentiment of a movie review.\n\t\t\t-   Creative writing: This task would include things like writing a poem or a love letter.\n\n### LLaMa and variants\n\nBrief history: https://agi-sphere.com/llama-models/ https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35736872\n\n- leaderboard https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard\n- llama2: [Latent Space writeup](https://www.latent.space/p/llama2#details)\n\t- [ylecun announcement](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1681336284453781505)\n\t- [finetuning recipes](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes)\n\t- ways to run\n\t\t- https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama\n\t\t- https://gpt4all.io/index.html\n\t\t- https://faraday.dev/\n\t\t- https://replicate.com/blog/run-llama-locally\n\t- list of openai compatibility layers https://llm-tracker.info/books/llms/page/openai-api-compatibility\n\t- 32k llama2 https://twitter.com/togethercompute/status/1685048832168714240\n\t- llama2 uncensored: https://huggingface.co/georgesung/llama2_7b_chat_uncensored\n\t\t- wizard-vicuna dataset\n\t\t- nous hermes -   Llama 2 13B model fine-tuned on over 300,000 instructions.

So this project enables the other frameworks. download : https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF\n\t- PrivateGPT - Similar to GPT4All, PrivateGPT also comes with a nice UI to chat with LLMs. Its focus does not lie on trying out many different models, but rather on interacting with your own documents 100% privately. It provides a nice @Gradio frontend where you can easily upload your files and then query the documents.\n\t- Ollama allows you to run LLMs locally through your command line and is probably the easiest framework to get started with. Just use the installer or the command line to install it. Then you can type `ollama run modelname` and it starts an interactive session where you can send prompts. It supports all important models like llama2, mistral, vicunia, falcon, and many more. And trying out new models is as easy as running `ollama pull modelname`.\n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/11o6o3f/how_to_install_llama_8bit_and_4bit/\n- llama alternatives https://thesequence.substack.com/p/the-llama-effect-how-an-accidental\n\t- Redpajama\n\t\t- https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama\n\t\t- https://venturebeat.com/ai/redpajama-replicates-llama-to-build-open-source-state-of-the-art-llms/\n\t\t- openllama the release of preview of the 7B OpenLLaMA model that has been trained with 200 billion tokens on the RedPajama dataset.\n\t\t\t- https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama\n\t\t\t- finetune openllama https://twitter.com/akshat_b/status/1658123298654355457\n\t\t\t- https://huggingface.co/openlm-research/open_llama_13bh\n\t\t\t\t- cant be used for code https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36383332\n\t- [Researchers from  UC Berkeley, CMU, Stanford, and UC San Diego open sourced Vicuna](https://vicuna.lmsys.org/), a fine-tuned version of LLama that matches GPT-4 performance.\n\t-   [Berkeley AI Research Institute(BAIR) released Koala](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2023/04/03/koala/), a version of LLama fine-tuned using internet dialogs.\n\t-   [Nebuly open sourced ChatLLama](https://github.com/nebuly-ai/nebullvm/tree/main/apps/accelerate/chatllama), a framework for creating conversational assistants using your own data.\n\t-   [FreedomGPT is an open source conversational agent](https://freedomgpt.com/) based on Alpaca which is based on LLama.\n\t-   [The Colossal-AI project from UC Berkeley released ColossalChat](https://medium.com/@yangyou_berkeley/colossalchat-an-open-source-solution-for-cloning-chatgpt-with-a-complete-rlhf-pipeline-5edf08fb538b), a ChatGPT type model with a complete RLHF pipeline based on LLama.\n\t- GPT4all \n\t\t- a 7B param language model finetuned from a curated set of 400k GPT-Turbo-3.5 assistant-style generation.

With small dataset and sample lengths of 256, you can even run this on a regular Colab Tesla T4 instance. With this intuitive UI, you can easily manage your dataset, customize parameters, train, and evaluate the model's inference capabilities.\n\t- with LoRA https://replicate.com/blog/fine-tune-alpaca-with-lora\n\t- with LLaMA adapter https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1641457696074334209?s=20 it's not finetuning the whole model end-to-end. Instead, the Adapter-approach adds a small number of 1.2M parameters on top of a pretrained, frozen 7B LLaMA model. Using the same 52K Instruction-following data, responses are comparable to Alpaca, but in contrast to Alpaca, which took 3 hours on 8 A100 to finetune, LLaMA adapters can be finetuned in 1h.\n\t- But in short, the difference is that this inserts adapter layers on top of the model. In contrast, LoRA decomposes the model weight matrices using low-rank decomposition. So, LoRA increases finetuning performance by reducing parameter numbers whereas Adapters increases efficiency by keeping the pretrained model frozen (and only tunes a small number of parameters added to the model).\n- Alapaca\n\t- [alpaca.cpp](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp) Locally run an Instruction-Tuned Chat-Style LLM\n\t- https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/13/alpaca/\n\t- Alpaca 7B was trained for less than $600.

There are three important abilities that the initial GPT-3 exhibit: Language generation, In-context learning, World knowledge\n  - to pretrain the 175B parameters model on 300B tokens (60% [2016 - 2019 C4](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/lectures/data/) https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4 + 22% WebText2 + 16% Books + 3% Wikipedia).\n  - **Language generation** comes from **training objective**\n  - **World knowldge** comes from **300b token corpus** and **stored in 175b model**\n  - The ability of complex reasoning with chain-of-thought is likely to be a magical side product of training on code\n  - We have concluded:\n    - The language generation ability + basic world knowledge + in-context learning are from pretraining (`davinci`)\n    - The ability to store a large amount of knowledge is from the 175B scale.\n    - The ability to follow instructions and generalizing to new tasks are from scaling instruction tuning (`davinci-instruct-beta`)\n    - The ability to perform complex reasoning is likely to be from training on code (`code-davinci-002`)\n    - The ability to generate neutral, objective, safe, and informative answers are from alignment with human. Specifically:\n      - If supervised tuning, the resulting model is `text-davinci-002`\n      - If RLHF, the resulting model is `text-davinci-003`\n      - Either supervised or RLHF, the models cannot outperform code-davinci-002 on many tasks, which is called the alignment tax.\n    - The dialog ability is also from RLHF (`ChatGPT`), specifically it tradeoffs in-context learning for:\n      - Modeling dialog history\n      - Increased informativeness\n      - Rejecting questions outside the model’s knowledge scope\n  - https://jaykmody.com/blog/gpt-from-scratch/\n\t  - https://github.com/jaymody/picoGPT\n  - OpenAI trained their original GPTs to pay special attention to <|endoftext|> for separating documents. But <|endoftext|> was in fact a special token: [50256]. Encoders need to encode that text string specially, since otherwise there's itno way to generate [50256]. https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sillysaurusx\n\n## Don't call it generative\n\n- Reasoning: https://twitter.com/alexandr_wang/status/1588933553290870785\n\t- https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-is-a-reasoning-engine\n- Understanding: https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1585903983180537856\n- stochastic parrot/autoregressive model counterpoints https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1639661303785721859?s=20\n- \n\n## Specialized language models\n\n- Scientific language models like Meta's Galactica exist.

BUT a big limitation of LLM’s is context size (4096 in Davinci), and if you want to feed an LLM custom knowledge it will either need to fit in the prompt or be finetuned (expensive)!\n  - https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1609225733934616577?s=46&t=DgrykKeTlGWgdxRkv2_tKw\n- godly ai https://godly.ai\n- HyDE: Hypothetical Document Embeddings\n  - https://twitter.com/mathemagic1an/status/1615378778863157248\n  - Take your query => create _hypothetical_ answer => embed hypothetical answer => use this to search through doc embeddings\n- [Structured Prompting: Scaling In-Context Learning to 1,000 Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06713)\n\n## Ethical issues\n\n- tokens are more 16x expensive for other languages https://denyslinkov.medium.com/why-is-gpt-3-15-77x-more-expensive-for-certain-languages-2b19a4adc4bc\n- Galactica fallout\n  - https://twitter.com/Michael_J_Black/status/1593133722316189696\n  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33611265\n  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTs_mXwMCs8&t=19s\n\n## Flan-T5\n\n- https://twitter.com/quocleix/status/1583523186376785921\n- Flan-T5 is instruction-finetuned on 1,800+ language tasks, leading to dramatically improved prompting and multi-step reasoning abilities.\n  - 7 min summary video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqi0QrbdgdI\n\n## Misc Text AI\n\n- OpenAI NarrativeQA Summarizing books https://openai.com/blog/summarizing-books/\n- GPT2 chess story with shawn presser and gwern https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/06/a-very-unlikely-chess-game/\n\n## Karpathy analogies\n\n- https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1644183721405464576\n- The analogy between GPTs of today to the CPUs of early days of computing are interesting. GPT is a funny kind of programmable text computer. Have to think through it more !\n- Memory \n\t- GPT-4 RAM is ~log2(50K vocab size)*(32K context length)/(8 bits/byte) ~= 64kB, roughly a Commodore64. Just as then, optimizing this precious resource is critical. GPT registers are the residual stream. There are d_model of them, e.g. GPT-3 has ~12K registers. VLIW architecture vibes. \n- CPU \n\t- The LOAD instruction is the Attention mechanism, except it can address by both location and/or content. \n\t- The STORE instruction is forced every n_layer number of clock cycles. \n\t- The ALU are the MLPs + LayerNorms.\n\t- Awkwardly, as their params are not shared across layers, the ALU changes at each clock cycle. \n\t- Optionally the MLPs may also be interpreted as supporting a kind of fixed knowledge database lookup. The programs always takes the form [[LOAD, ALU]*N, STORE]*M, where N is n_layer and M is num_tokens. \n- Architecture GPT feels closer to a fixed-function than stored-program computer because the number of parameters is so large. In contrast, the description length of a CPU is very low and all the action is in the memory configuration. Another way to look at it is that GPT is a much more bloated/complex computer. Which is fine because it is not engineered but optimized and the upshot is that the programs can be shorter.\n- related: div garg version of software 3.0 https://divgarg.substack.com/p/software-3\n"}
