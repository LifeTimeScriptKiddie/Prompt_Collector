Technology Stack Rigidity\n- Framework assumes traditional web app patterns (Python/JavaScript)\n- No clear path for handling ML/AI, mobile, or specialized domains\n- Checks are somewhat ad-hoc rather than systematically organized\n- Binary technology assumptions don't match modern hybrid MCP servers\n\n#### 2. Audit Path Selection Limitations\n- Simple binary choice between \"comprehensive\" vs \"targeted\"\n- Doesn't account for technology-specific audit needs\n- A Python MCP server vs a UI framework require fundamentally different approaches\n- No guidance for domain-specific risk prioritization\n\n#### 3. Check Organization Problems\n- Checks are flat in `/checks/` directory with no clear categorization\n- No dependency relationships between checks\n- Difficult to determine which checks apply to specific technology stacks\n- No systematic way to handle cross-domain security concerns\n\n### Potential Structural Improvements\n\n#### A. Technology-Aware Audit Routing\nInstead of just comprehensive/targeted, consider domain-specific audit paths:\n```\n/audit-paths/\n├── traditional-mcp-server/     # Current approach works well\n├── ai-ml-enhanced/            # ML models, training data, inference\n├── web-scraping-automation/   # SSRF, sandbox escape, legal compliance\n├── ui-framework-enabled/      # XSS, iframe, component security\n├── gateway-proxy/             # Request forwarding, upstream trust\n└── multi-technology/          # Cross-language, build security\n```\n\n#### B. Hierarchical Check System\nOrganize security checks by scope and applicability:\n```\n/checks/\n├── core/                      # Apply to all MCP servers\n│   ├── credential-management/\n│   ├── basic-authentication/\n│   └── network-binding/\n├── domains/                   # Domain-specific security\n│   ├── ai-ml/\n│   │   ├── model-security/\n│   │   ├── training-data-privacy/\n│   │   └── inference-vulnerabilities/\n│   ├── web-scraping/\n│   │   ├── ssrf-detection/\n│   │   ├── sandbox-escape/\n│   │   └── legal-compliance/\n│   └── ui-frameworks/\n│       ├── xss-prevention/\n│       ├── iframe-security/\n│       └── component-validation/\n└── integrations/              # Third-party specific\n    ├── llm-apis/\n    │   ├── prompt-injection/\n    │   └── output-sanitization/\n    └── cloud-services/\n        ├── api-validation/\n        └── service-trust/\n```\n\n#### C. Enhanced Risk Context Framework\n- Current AIVSS scoring may need domain-specific weighting\n- ML model compromise vs credential exposure have different impact profiles\n- UI framework XSS vs API injection require different remediation priorities\n- Risk assessment should account for deployment context AND technology domain\n\n#### D. Extensibility Considerations\n- How to add new domains without breaking existing audits?\n- Should there be automated \"domain detection\" that routes to appropriate checks?\n- How to handle hybrid servers (e.g., MCP server + ML + UI components)?\n- Backward compatibility strategy for evolving check system\n\n### Key Structural Questions\n\n1. **Audit Path Strategy**: Technology-specific paths vs enhanced universal approach?\n2. **Check Dependencies**: Should checks have prerequisites or run in sequences?\n3. **Domain Detection**: Auto-detect technology stack vs manual selection?\n4. **Backward Compatibility**: How to evolve without breaking existing workflows?\n5. **Teaching Approach**: Does the Socratic method work equally well across all domains?\n6. **Hybrid Systems**: How to audit servers that span multiple domains?\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n#### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements\n- Reorganize existing checks into hierarchical structure\n- Add domain tags to existing checks\n- Create technology detection guidance\n\n#### Phase 2: Domain Expansion\n- Implement priority domain-specific check sets\n- Develop domain-aware audit routing\n- Create domain-specific risk weighting\n\n#### Phase 3: Advanced Features\n- Automated technology stack detection\n- Check dependency management\n- Dynamic audit path generation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur current audit framework provides excellent coverage for traditional MCP servers but has significant gaps in emerging domains like AI/ML, web scraping, and modern UI frameworks. Beyond adding missing security checks, the framework needs structural improvements to handle the growing diversity and complexity of MCP server implementations. Addressing both the content gaps and structural limitations would significantly improve our coverage of the evolving MCP server ecosystem.\n"}
