All file operations and command executions MUST be strictly confined to the designated virtualized project environment (`VIRTUAL_ROOT`).\n2.  **Local Primary:** Design and implement features with local execution (on macOS M3+) as the primary target. Leverage local AI models (Ollama/llama.cpp), local STT, and local tools whenever feasible for privacy, speed, and offline capability.\n3.  **User Control & Transparency:** While automation is key, provide mechanisms for user oversight. Log actions clearly. Consider confirmation steps for potentially destructive operations initially.\n4.  **Modularity & Maintainability:** Build components with clear responsibilities and interfaces (especially if using MCP). Keep code clean, organized, and well-documented. Adhere to file size limits (e.g., < 300 lines) and refactor proactively.\n5.  **Simplicity:** Prefer simple, robust solutions over complex ones, especially in early phases. Iterate and add complexity gradually.\n\n## Development Rules\n\n*   **DO NOT** allow any file system access (read, write, delete) or command execution outside the defined `VIRTUAL_ROOT` boundary. Rigorously test path validation (`safe_path`).\n*   **DO NOT** bypass the virtualized environment checks for any reason.\n*   **ALWAYS** commit changes to the local Git repository after significant AI actions (file creation/modification) within the `VIRTUAL_ROOT`.\n*   **ALWAYS** handle errors gracefully for file operations, subprocess calls, AI model interactions, and API calls. Provide informative feedback to the user or logs.\n*   **PREFER** using the integrated local AI model (via the `run_ollama` wrapper or MCP) for tasks like code generation, modification, and analysis.\n*   **AVOID** hardcoding absolute paths outside the `VIRTUAL_ROOT` context. Use relative paths within the virtual environment or construct paths using `VIRTUAL_ROOT`.\n*   **AVOID** relying solely on cloud services for core functionality if a local alternative is feasible and meets requirements.\n*   **DO NOT** introduce complex new patterns or technologies without first attempting to solve the problem using existing patterns.\n*   **ALWAYS** check for existing code/functionality before writing new code to avoid duplication.\n*   **ENSURE** all code related to file system interaction or execution rigorously enforces the `VIRTUAL_ROOT` boundary.\n*   **WRITE** tests for critical components, especially safety mechanisms (virtual root validation) and core workflows.\n*   **ITERATE** on existing functionality rather than making drastic changes without discussion.\n*   **FOCUS** on the tasks defined in `task.md`. Do not add unrelated features without discussion.\n*   **DISCUSS** significant architectural changes, visual changes (UI), or deviations from the plan before implementation.\n\n## AI Interaction Rules\n\n*   **SANITIZE** or carefully review prompts sent to the AI, especially if they include user input, to prevent prompt injection or unintended requests.\n*   **VALIDATE** AI-generated code where possible (e.g., basic syntax checks) before saving or executing.\n*   **BE AWARE** of potential AI hallucinations or incorrect outputs; implement checks or fallback logic where critical.\n*   **DO NOT** implicitly trust AI-generated commands for execution without review or safety checks (e.g., filter dangerous commands like `rm -rf /`).\n\n## Environment Rules\n\n*   **ENSURE** Docker containers run with appropriate isolation and resource limits.\n*   **MANAGE** container lifecycles properly (start, stop, cleanup).\n*   **SECURE** any remote MCP servers with appropriate authentication/authorization if implemented.
