={"data":"# What is JailbreakMe? 🚀\n\n[jailbreakme.xyz](https://www.jailbreakme.xyz) is an **open-source decentralized app (dApp)** where organizations test their **AI models and agents** while users **earn rewards** for finding weaknesses and jailbreaking them 🏆\n\n![image1.jpg](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/194c2c19da77355c027b6994e4286740.jpg)\n\n# What is an AI Prompt Injection? 💉\n\n**Prompt Injection** is a vulnerability where an attacker manipulates the input or prompt given to an AI system. This can occur:\n\n- By directly controlling the input.\n- By using data from other external sources.\n\n# Our Vision\n\nWe aim to create a decentralized platform where companies can:\n\n- Test their AI models and agents in a distributed environment.\n- Identify **prompt vulnerabilities** and weaknesses **before production deployment**.\n\n# 🏁 How It Works\n\n## 1. Participate:\n\n### 1.1 Choose an agent:\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 20.28.00.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/194c2c5594fd945a276d4174a06bd662.png)\n\n### 1.2 Break the LLM Restrictions 🤖\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 20.31.36.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/194c2c95384738d8595c6f944e8a8b88.png)\n\n### 1.3 Win the Prize Pool 🏆\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 20.32.00.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/194c2c987531c3a7c064c7544a5aca12.png)\n\n# How is the Winner Picked? 🤔\n\nThe selection of the winning user is determined entirely by the **AI model itself**. The AI evaluates all incoming prompts and decides whether a submission meets the challenge requirements by calling one of two predefined functions:\n\n1. `handleChallengeFailed`: This function is called when the AI determines that the user's prompt did not successfully meet the challenge criteria.\n2. `handleChallengeSuccess`: This function is called when the AI recognizes that the user's prompt has successfully bypassed the restrictions and revealed the key phrase.\n\nWhen the `handleChallengeSuccess` function is triggered, the prize pool is automatically awarded to the user whose message caused the function to be called. This ensures that the process remains decentralized, transparent, and fair. 🎉\n\n## 2. Launch an agent:\n\n### 2.1 Choose how would you like to create your agent\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 20.36.38.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/194c2cdfc0a6514c80fba3c4d1b800f5.png)\n\n### 2.2 Prompt Launch\n\nDescribe your agent's personality and behavior. Our AI will generate a complete agent configuration based on your description.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 20.38.21.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/194c2ceb3aa1e48e8de932146b6b2d6c.png)\n\n### 2.3 Quick Creation\n\nCreate a simple \"Secret Phrase\" challenge with default options.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 20.38.42.png](https://cdn.dorahacks.io/static/files/194c2d0afb312097be5bef543cf8898f.png)\n\n### 2.4 Advanced Creation\n\nMultiple configurations + function calls:\n\n[![Advanced Creation Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/D-YAFGzqExk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-YAFGzqExk)\n\n### 2.5 API Integration\n\nSubmit the form and we will create a custom integration with your API.\n\n# 📜 Settings & Rules\n\nEach tournament has unique rules, including:\n\n- **Custom Prize Pools**\n- **Message Pricing**\n- **Expiry Settings**\n\n# 🔗 Useful Links\n\n- **X**: [https://x.com/jailbreakme_xyz](https://x.com/jailbreakme_xyz)\n- **Telegram Community**: [https://t.me/jailbreakme_xyz](https://t.me/jailbreakme_xyz)\n- **Documentation**: [https://jailbreakme.xyz/docs](https://jailbreakme.xyz/docs)\n- **Github Repo**: [https://github.com/jailbreakme-xyz/jailbreak](https://github.com/jailbreakme-xyz/jailbreak)\n- **Smart Contract**: [https://solscan.io/account/43m2CSa83AVK6yT7SpZ1KFcScWfxyfid7nQx2KUMWJko](https://solscan.io/account/43m2CSa83AVK6yT7SpZ1KFcScWfxyfid7nQx2KUMWJko)\n\n# Feedback & Support\n\nFeel free to reach out at **dev@jailbreakme.xyz** for feedback or support.\n\nJailbreak the World 🦍\n"}
