  "data": "# TSA Assistant Bot\n\nA Q&A system that helps both coaches and parents get instant, accurate answers about Texas Sports Academy.\n\n## Problem\n\n**For Coaches**: Complex partnership questions about starting schools (insurance, legal structure, costs) require lengthy calls.\n**For Parents**: Staff spend **10+ hours/week** answering repetitive questions about schedules, fees, and logistics.\n\n## Solution\n\nAI chat that searches TSA documents and responds instantly. Available 24/7. No login required.\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Parent asks:** \"When is fall registration?\"\n2. **Bot searches** uploaded TSA documents  \n3. **Bot responds:** \"Fall registration opens June 1st (Source: Parent Handbook)\"\n\nIf the answer isn't in the documents, bot says: *\"I don't have that information.\"*\n\n**Example Questions**\n\n*Parent Questions:*\n- \"What time is practice for 7 year olds?\"\n- \"Where do I buy uniforms?\"\n- \"Can I carry over makeup classes?\"\n\n*Coach Questions:*\n- \"Is this a franchise?\"\n- \"What insurance do I need?\"\n- \"Can international students enroll with F-1 visas?\"\n- \"How does the $15k tuition split work?\"\n\n**Zero Configuration** - Works out-of-the-box by recognizing universal patterns (schedules, policies, equipment lists) that every youth sports org shares.\n\n## MVP Features\n\n**Parent Interface**\n- Clean chat at tsa-bot.vercel.app\n- Mobile-first (parents in parking lots)\n- No sign up\n- 3-second response timeout\n- Vercel/Linear design aesthetic (Geist font, clean spacing)\n\n**Admin Panel** (for Lamar & Malekai)\n- Upload PDFs, Word docs, audio files\n- Add Q&A pairs directly (for edge cases)\n- Delete outdated documents\n- Password protected\n- Tag content by audience (coach/parent)\n\n## Out of scope\n- User accounts\n- Chat history persistence\n- Analytics dashboard\n- Multi-language (English only for MVP)\n- Real-time notifications\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n```\nTypeScript 5.6+ → End-to-end type safety\nNext.js 15 (App Router) + shadcn/ui → Server Components, PPR, clean UI  \nTailwind CSS v4.1+ → Modern CSS with Oxide engine\nBun 1.2+ → Fast runtime, built-in test runner\nVercel AI SDK v5 → Streaming, tool calling, provider flexibility\nOpenAI GPT-5-mini → Balance of performance & cost (gpt-5 for complex queries)\nSupabase + pgvector → Document search (no separate vector DB needed)\nVercel → Zero-config deployment with Edge Functions\n```\n\n**Data Flow**\n1. Upload PDF/Audio → Extract text/Transcribe → Generate embeddings → Store in pgvector\n   - PDF: pdfjs-dist (more reliable than pdf-parse)\n   - Audio: OpenAI Whisper API (alternative: Deepgram for speed)\n   - Embeddings: text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions, $0.02/1M tokens)\n2. User asks → Search vectors → Retrieve context → Stream response\n   - Similarity search: pgvector with HNSW indexing\n   - Context window: 8K tokens max\n   - Streaming: Server-sent events via AI SDK\n\n**Performance Targets**\n- First response: < 200ms\n- Complete answer: < 2s\n- Search: < 100ms\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Accuracy**: \n  - 95%+ on common questions (top 20)\n  - 80%+ overall accuracy\n  - 100% transparent about sources\n- **Speed**: < 3 seconds per answer (< 7s for complex)\n- **Impact**: \n  - 70% fewer repetitive questions\n  - Clear escalation path for complex issues\n\n## Timeline\n\n**Day 1-2**: Chat interface  \n**Day 3-4**: Document system  \n**Day 5**: Testing & deploy\n\n**Total: 1 week**\n\n*Note: Working prototype in 10 minutes with starter code*\n\n## Cost\n\n- Build: 1 week\n- Run: ~$50-100/month\n  - OpenAI: $30-80 (GPT-5-mini: ~$0.10/1K questions)\n  - Supabase: Free tier (up to 500MB vectors)\n  - Vercel: Free tier (100GB bandwidth)\n- Maintain: ~1 hour/month\n- Scale: Linear with usage (no surprises)\n\n**Why not:** Pinecone (overkill), LangChain (too complex), AWS (too heavy)\n\n## Security & Privacy\n\n- **Rate limiting**: 10 requests/minute per IP\n- **Input sanitization**: Prevent prompt injection\n- **Admin auth**: Secure password hashing (bcrypt)\n- **HTTPS only**: Enforced at edge\n- **No PII storage**: Questions deleted after response\n\n## Architecture Patterns\n\n- **Server Components**: UI renders on server (fast initial load)\n- **Edge Functions**: API routes run closer to users\n- **Streaming UI**: Progressive response rendering\n- **Optimistic updates**: Instant feedback on uploads\n- **Smart chunking**: Semantic document splitting (not fixed-size)\n\n## What we need from TSA\n\n1. **Documents** (5 minutes) - Any PDFs you give parents\n2. **Contact info** (30 seconds) - Main office phone for fallback\n3. **Domain choice** (30 seconds) - assistant.texassportsacademy.com or we provide\n\nThat's it. No meetings. No committees. Just ship it.\n\n## Monitoring (Built-in)\n\n- **Vercel Analytics**: Page views, response times\n- **OpenAI Dashboard**: Token usage, costs\n- **Supabase Dashboard**: Query performance\n- **Error tracking**: Automatic via Vercel\n- **Uptime**: 99.9% (Vercel SLA)\n\n---\n\nSimple solution to a real problem. Ready to build."
