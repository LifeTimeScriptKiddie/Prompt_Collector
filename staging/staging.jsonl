  "data": "# AI Sales Assistant for Small Businesses\n\n## 🚀 Overview\n\nThis project is a **full-stack AI workflow platform** designed to help small businesses automate lead engagement, appointment booking, and follow-ups — directly through WhatsApp.\n\nIt’s built to **showcase real-world AI integration, backend logic in Elixir/Phoenix, and a fast SvelteKit frontend** — exactly the kind of product ChatAvocado is building.\n\nThe goal: a demo-ready system that proves you can ship production-grade software, integrate AI intelligently, and build features that *move the needle* for SMBs.\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Core Features\n\n### 1. **Smart Lead Capture**\n- Business owners can connect their WhatsApp number or use a web chat widget.\n- When a customer sends a message (e.g. *“I want to book a repair”*), the system detects intent via OpenAI and routes it.\n- AI extracts relevant info (name, service, time, etc.) using structured outputs.\n\n### 2. **AI Appointment Scheduler**\n- AI proposes available times based on business schedule (stored in DB).\n- Customer confirms → booking is created in the backend via Phoenix API.\n- Sends WhatsApp confirmation and calendar invite.\n\n### 3. **Automatic Follow-Ups**\n- Every evening, the system checks for pending or inactive leads.\n- Uses an AI-generated follow-up message that sounds natural but personalized.\n- Sends via WhatsApp API with rate limiting and opt-out control.\n\n### 4. **Business Dashboard (SvelteKit Frontend)**\n- Real-time view of conversations, leads, and bookings.\n- Create/edit schedule, view analytics (conversion rate, response time).\n- Includes live message preview of AI responses before they’re sent.\n\n### 5. **Admin + Monitoring**\n- Admin panel for managing businesses and tokens.\n- Background job queue (Oban) for follow-ups and message retries.\n- Simple metrics dashboard: message count, response success, AI cost tracking.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 Tech Stack\n\n### Backend\n- **Language:** Elixir + Phoenix Framework  \n- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Ecto ORM)  \n- **Job Queue:** Oban  \n- **Deployment:** Fly.io or Render  \n- **Integrations:** OpenAI API, WhatsApp Cloud API  \n\n### Frontend\n- **Framework:** SvelteKit  \n- **Language:** TypeScript  \n- **Styling:** TailwindCSS  \n- **State Management:** Svelte writable stores  \n- **Realtime:** Phoenix Channels or WebSockets for live chat updates  \n\n### AI Layer\n- **LLM:** OpenAI GPT-4 (function calling for structured actions)\n- **Prompt Orchestration:** Context building for each business + chat memory\n- **Guardrails:** Type validation, fallback responses, and logging\n\n---\n\n## 🔐 Security & Reliability\n- All API keys and secrets stored via environment variables.\n- Rate limiting per business to avoid abuse.\n- Messages sanitized to prevent prompt injection.\n- HTTPS enforced in production.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 Architecture Diagram (Conceptual)\n\nCustomer → WhatsApp API → Phoenix API → AI Layer → Business Logic (DB)\n↓\nSvelteKit Dashboard\n\nyaml\nCopy code\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Learning Outcomes\n\nBy building this project, I demonstrate:\n\n- ✅ Full-stack engineering (Elixir/Phoenix + SvelteKit + TypeScript)\n- ✅ Designing scalable APIs and background systems\n- ✅ Integrating AI workflows that *do work*, not just chat\n- ✅ Building production-ready features with monitoring and observability\n- ✅ Understanding of small business needs and user workflows\n- ✅ Speed, ownership, and product-first mindset\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Potential Extensions\n\n- Multi-agent orchestration (AI scheduler + AI support rep)\n- Webhook integration for CRMs (HubSpot, Notion, etc.)\n- Voice note understanding via Whisper API\n- Analytics dashboard with real-time event streams\n\n---\n\n## 🧭 Next Steps\n1. Scaffold Phoenix + SvelteKit monorepo.\n2. Build core APIs for messages and bookings.\n3. Integrate OpenAI for intent detection + function calls.\n4. Build real-time SvelteKit dashboard.\n5. Deploy on Fly.io or Render with monitoring.\n\n---\n\n## 🧑‍💻 Author\n**Daniel Obentey**  \nBuilder | Problem Solver | AI + Full-Stack Engineer  \n_\"Let’s keep growing together, one imperfect day at a time.\"_\n\n"
